# ZeoTap Assignments

This repository contains two advanced applications developed as part of the ZeoTap assignment:

1. Rule Engine with AST
2. Real-Time Weather Monitoring System

## Projects Overview

### 1. Rule Engine with AST

A sophisticated 3-tier rule engine application that determines user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, and experience. It uses Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to represent and evaluate conditional rules.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic creation and modification of rules
- AST-based rule representation
- Rule combination and evaluation
- FastAPI backend with Flutter frontend

A Flutter application that provides real-time weather updates, historical data visualization, and temperature alerts for multiple cities.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time weather updates for multiple cities
- Temperature alert system
- Historical weather data visualization
- Customizable temperature units
